#Animation Examples

##**Let's Make a Cool Knot**

###This is an animation example, modified from code used in a Udacity animation class.

I customized the buttons, the randomized colors and the shape.

- Click on the 'random color change' button to toggle between a solid random color and rapidly-changing random colors.
- Click on the reset button to start over.
- Click on the pause/play to pause the animation.
- Click pause/play again to resume the animation.
- Click on the 'download' to save your image.
- Click on the very bottom link for the second example.

##**Let's Make a Circle**

###This is another animation example, modified from a webcast lecture on Udacity.

It creates a spinner - a line that spins, anchored in the center, and changes to random colors.

- Click on the Start/Pause button to start and stop the animation.
- Click on the Reset button to start over.
